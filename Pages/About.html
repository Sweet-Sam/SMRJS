        <p class="par">Heya, the name's Sam. Long story short I just got too much free time and figured I'd shout my
          opinions out into the void
          that is the internet, like any good user of it. Like any other good user of the internet I also know that no
          one really cares, but I figure
          I may as well archive my thoughts somewhere and I know for a fact I can't keep a diary or journal.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="par">The cat which I will probably post a whole lot of (the funny little guy in the picture in this
          page) is Caiman, he's still young, 'round
          4 months as of writing this, and he may be an annoying, unbearable asshole sometimes but I still love him at
          the end of the day, even if I really wish
          I could sleep through the morning without getting either clawed, chewed or having my ears mewoed out.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="par">
          More about me though. I like writing, playing games, procrastinating, and I spend the majority of my free time
          with music in my ears. I'm still not published
          , but someday, maybe in a few weeks, I'll have a book that's at least halfway decent out there so I can plug
          it and hopefully make some money, but it's not
          like I really expect to be able to make any sort of living out of writing unless I get really lucky.
        </p>
        <p class="par">Other than that, I don't know much else to say that I'm not going to go over in my rambles, which
          outside of the Ramble of The Week, will be posted
          pretty much whenever I feel like posting one. Don't ask me for a schedule on the weekly one either, I probably
          won't follow it anyways.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="par">One last thing: I wanted to get a picture of Caiman yawning, with a wide open mouth, to make it
          look like he was shouting, for the logo, but until then we'll make do with the current one.
