      <h1>Guilty Gear: Different Isn't Better or Worse.</h1> <br>

      <p class="par">Guilty Gear Strive. I like it. Sure, my relationship with it is complicated at best, strenuous at
        worst, but to say I outright disilke it
        or something like that would be a lie. Strive is the latest game of the Guilty Gear series, the first game to
        come out in more than 4 or so years,
        and it is very, very different from it's predecessors in a few very important ways. The game was developed with
        the intent of hooking in new players,
        and I can say from experience, it worked. Strive is the first fighting game that not only me, but a good amount
        of people in my friend group, have
        actually gotten into and enjoyed, that's in part due to it being a "simpler" game than the previous ones (Xrd
        and XX notoriously required a whole glossary
        to understand all of the systems in those games), in part due to Strive looking absolutely amazing, and in
        another part due to the banger soundtrack. </p>
      <br>

        allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="par">With visuals like that, and a soundtrack that can hype you up so much during a match, it's very
        easy to get hoooked on Strive, and for a lot of
        of people, Strive will be the only game that they play, specially if it's their first fighting game. For curious
        people like me though, it will be a gateway
        drug instead. Some of the reason for it might be the fact that Strive wasn't the first Guilty Gear game I
        played, it was instead Guilty Gear X, the second
        game in the series. Don't get me wrong, Guilty Gear X is a broken mess in terms of balancing and the likes, but
        it's broken in a way that you and a friend
        can have a lot of fun just mashing buttons against each other while in a discord call.
      </p>
      <p class="par">So, with my interest in the gateway drug waving after around 200 hours of playing Strive, I decided
        to find a new game to get into with my friends,
        and as luck would halve it, Blazblue Central Fiction happened to be on sale. Though published by the same studio
        and with people from Guilty Gear involved,
        Blazblue is the polar opposite of Strive. Just like the previous GG games, it's a game so complex a glossary is
        required to list all the game systems, though not
        necessarily in the same way that XX and Xrd are complex (All three of them have a LOT of systems, BB just has
        systems that were never integrated into guilty gear
        and vice versa). With my friends also getting into it, BBCF became my new drug. Every other day, we'd get
        together and fight each other until someone raged and left.
        Blazblue made me realize that I like learning game systems, and thus, made me grow a distate for strive. Me and
        a lot of people enjoyed the previous games as they were,
        why change it?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="par">For a while, it remained at just that, until my friends wanted to play Strive again. Begrudginly, I
        played it with them, at first enjoying it, before
        quickly getting annoyed by some aspects of the game, such as the ridiculous amount of particles on screen when a
        counter hit occurs, and for a while after it also
        kind of stayed like that. I'd join a call, they were playing strive, I'd join, get annoyed at the game, they'd
        get annoyed at the character I play (common occurrence
        when I'm playing a fighting game.) and we'd all just kinda not have that great of a time. Eventually though, and
        I'm not sure why, perhaps more exposure to the game,
        I realized that I do like Strive, even for all it's failures, my main problem with it is that it simply didn't
        go full in on being a cut back game that focuses purely
        on execution and neutral skill rather than technical skill as the previous games often did.
      </p>
      <p class="par">I think the realization probably came due to the DLC characters, more specifically the last two of
        Season 1, Baiken and Testament, main thing they have in common
        is how small their movelists are. 6 Specials in total if counting the Supers, 4 if not. Yeah it's not the same
        as they were in previous games, their abilities being much more
        limited, and both of them missing what once was the key aspect of their gameplay and win-state, but I liked it.
        It feels as if Strive has started moving towards really
        cutting out the fat, leaving only muscle, and part of me really really wishes that that would apply to the whole
        cast of characters, but that is now just a wish, not a thing that
        I hold against the game as I once did.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="par">Strive is a very different game from XX and Xrd, so much so that saying it's, as a whole, better or
        worse than those two is a lie at best, absolutely completely moronic
        at worst. Strive does have aspects that are objectively better than Xrd and XX to an extent, such as the Netcode
        (Since it's release, Strive is the golden standard for Rollback Netcode,
        and even though XX does have rollback, it's not quite on the same level.) or the combo recipe mode, where you
        can just pick a combo someone else has made and then do it with the instructions
        on your screen in-game, instead of having to look at an outside source such as Dustloop. Strive also has things
        that are objectively worse such as the new lobby system, which
        although fancy, is clunky, unresponsive and slow. But, at the end of the day, Strive aimed to do something very
        different from what came before it, the situation can indeed be compared
        to what happened between Risk of Rain and Risk of Rain 2, but to a way greated extent, since ROR2 is very much
        so nothing but ROR, but in a 3D space.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="par">TL;DR: Strive is neither better or worse than the previous games as a whole, it's just different,
        and that's very much Ok.</p>
